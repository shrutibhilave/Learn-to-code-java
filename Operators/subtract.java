Java allows for a wide range of arithmetic operations, from the simplest calculation to the most complex algorithm.
In maths, Subtraction is same as addition but the one operand is of negatuve sign. 
in java, when there are two operands with a subtract sign, the program will subtract second operand from one.

class Subtract
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int num1,num2,result;
		num1=12;
		num2=8;
		System.out.println("num1=12; num2=8");
		result=num1-num2;
		System.out.println("The result after subtraction of these numbers is : "+result);
	}
}
