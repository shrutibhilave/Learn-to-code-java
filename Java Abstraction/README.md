# Abstraction in Java

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.

Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
- Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

**Abstraction is used in Java to achieve security- hide certain details and display only the important details of an object.**

Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.

An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.

To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the `implements` keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class.
