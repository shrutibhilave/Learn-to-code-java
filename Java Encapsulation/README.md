# Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation in Java is a Object-Oriented-Programming concept. It is a technique of wrapping data and code together into a single unit.

Simple Example of Encapsulation in real life is – A Capsule, several medicines are wrapped into one outer layer.

In Java, class is the example of encapsulation. A class wraps code (method) and data(variables) together.

This concept ensures that data members of a class are always hidden from other classes. We can only access those data members using the methods.

Encapsulation is also known as data-hiding as it prevents data to be accessed by the code outside the class.

# Advantages of Encapsulation in Java

Encapsulation in java has many advantages, which are mentioned below :

- We can make read-only and write-only classes using encapsulation.
- We can achieve data hiding.
- The encapsulated classes are better for unit testing.
- It is easy and fast.
- We have control over data.

# Encapsulation vs Abstraction

Encapsulation and Abstraction are two different topics but many get confused between both of them .

Let’s look at the difference :

- Abstraction deals with “What”.
- Encapsulation deals with “How”.

Abstraction hides the complex functionalities and encapsulation binds the functionalities.
