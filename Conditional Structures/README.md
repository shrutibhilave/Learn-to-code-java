# Java Conditions and If Statements

## Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b
    Equal to a == b
    Not Equal to: a != b

## You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

## Java has the following conditional statements:

-  Use if to specify a block of code to be executed,    if a specified condition is true
-    Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Else is always used after an if block.
-    Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false. Else If is also used after an If condition.
